                The gift of engineering has been propelling our world to newfound heights. As a learning engineer, I strive to learn how professionals use basic principals and apply them to create elaborate, intricate designs. I love engineering, whether that be mechanical or software. With mechanical engineering, you can repair or create things you use in everyday life. With software engineering, you can write code that performs certain tasks to help people. I am currently enrolled in Principles of Engineering and took Computer Science Principles last year. I am also involved with Gael Force Robotics. My goal is to graduate from Dublin High School in 2021 and hopefully attend a prestigious college and earn a bachelor’s or master’s degree in engineering. My future from there on will most likely be jobs in the engineering field and hopefully my own company eventually.

                One of my proudest accomplishments so far is being selected for a competition robotics team at my school. It is a great learning opportunity, as in building the robot, we learn about all kinds of fields in engineering. We have to constantly repair things with electrical engineering or build the mechanisms on our robot using mechanical engineering. I am also learning how to code the robot using software engineering as a hobby. But, I am primarily a builder because I enjoy hands on work. Through the older members, I have learned to build many types of lifts and intake designs to make our robot as efficient as possible. Now, I am in my second year of robotics and could be considered one of the more experienced members on the team. Building a robot for competitions also takes persistence, it takes a lot of trial and error to get your robot working just right. To build a robot, you must also be precise. If the robot is messily built, mechanisms can go wrong and the robot will fail. Social skills are also necessary to make robotics an enjoyable experience. When we disagree, we are still able to keep it professional and we are still able to work together. Being able to become everyone’s friend is also a very useful skill in almost every situation. In my robotics team, I have learned to develop all these skills and more. Joining this team has been perfect to help me expand my skill set and learn about my passions. I hope to be captain of my own robotics team next year.

                I have had many experiences, but robotics by far has been the most useful and taught me many things about myself. I have learned that I truly do have a passion for engineering and it has helped me develop my skills in engineering and how to work in groups. Overall, I hope to accomplish all of my goals and keep on learning about my passions. Thank you for reading my about me.
